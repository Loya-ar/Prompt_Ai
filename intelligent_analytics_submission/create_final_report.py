- Data characteristics (size, type distribution)
- Domain identification (sales, marketing, HR)
- Temporal and geographic indicators
- Business-specific patterns

#### Learning Algorithm
```
UCB Selection: Q(s,a) + c√(ln(t)/N(s,a))
Q-Learning Update: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r - Q(s,a)]
Multi-Agent Coordination: Sequential execution with message passing
```

#### Performance Optimization

---

## Reinforcement Learning Methods

### Method 1: Contextual Bandits with UCB

#### Algorithm Implementation
The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm balances exploration and exploitation:

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Action Selection: a* = argmax[Q(s,a) + c√(ln(t)/N(s,a))]
Where:
- Q(s,a): Estimated value of action a in context s
- c: Confidence parameter (typically √2)
- t: Total number of trials
- N(s,a): Number of times action a was selected in context s
```

**Context Features:**
- Data size classification (small/medium/large)
- Domain type identification (sales/marketing/hr/general)
- Structural indicators (temporal/geographic data presence)
- Numerical vs categorical feature ratios

**Reward Function:**
```
R(s,a) = base_reward + domain_bonus + collaboration_bonus
Where:
- base_reward = 1.0 (successful analysis completion)
- domain_bonus = 0.0-0.5 (analysis quality specific to domain)
- collaboration_bonus = 0.2 (inter-agent communication)
```

### Method 2: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

#### Coordination Protocol
1. **Context Assessment**: Each agent evaluates data suitability
2. **Participation Decision**: Q-value based thresholds determine involvement
3. **Sequential Execution**: Ordered analysis with real-time adaptation
4. **Message Passing**: Insight sharing enhances collective learning
5. **Reward Distribution**: Individual and collaborative performance evaluation

#### Communication System
- **Message Types**: Insight sharing, analysis requests, context updates
- **Coordination Benefits**: 0.2 reward bonus for successful collaboration
- **Learning Enhancement**: Shared context improves individual agent decisions

#### Specialization Development
Agents learn domain-specific expertise through:
- Differential reward structures based on analysis type
- Context-specific Q-value learning
- Collaborative filtering of suitable tasks
- Dynamic participation thresholds
