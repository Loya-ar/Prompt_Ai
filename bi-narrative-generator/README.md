Issue: API Key Not Working
# Solution: Verify API key configuration
python -c "
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
print('API Key Length:', len(os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', '')))
print('API Key Preview:', os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', '')[:10] + '...')
"

Issue: Module Import Errors
# Solution: Reinstall dependencies
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
pip install -r requirements.txt

Issue: Data Upload Failures
# Solution: Check file encoding and format
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv', encoding='utf-8')
print(f'‚úÖ File loaded: {len(df)} records')
"

Issue: Slow Performance
# Solution: Optimize data processing
# Ensure dataset size < 50MB for optimal performance
# Use sample_frac() for large datasets: df.sample(frac=0.1)
